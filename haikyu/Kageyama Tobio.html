    <u><h2 style="color: coral;"> About</h2></u><hr>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Tobio Kageyama (影山 飛雄, Kageyama Tobio) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School. He is the team's starting setter and was notoriously known as the "King of the Court" in Junior High for his tyrannical sets and authoritarian-style leadership. Considered one of Karasuno's two prodigy players, his tenacious desire to win coupled with his lack of regard for the needs of his teammates caused them to abandon him in the middle of a match. Kageyama becomes deeply afraid of Karasuno abandoning him in a similar way and strives to be more considerate of the needs of his team. He originally tried to enroll at Shiratorizawa but was rejected. At Karasuno, Kageyama slowly learns the importance of trust, respect, and teamwork in volleyball. He forms an unlikely setter-spiker partnership with Shoyo Hinata, and the two develop their signature "freak" quickly. Known even among other schools as a 'volleyball genius', Kageyama is famous for his "pinpoint setting accuracy", serves, and game sense. Because it is his responsibility as a setter to "utilize" each spiker to their greatest potential, he functions as one of Karasuno's main pillars of attack. Though he is usually polite with good intentions, he nevertheless has poor social skills and difficulty expressing himself. He often engages in trivial competitions and shouting matches with Hinata. As of current, he plays for the Schweiden Adlers, along with Shiratorizawa's Wakatoshi Ushijima and Kamomedai's Korai. He and Hinata play for the Japanese National Team (in the future).</p>
    <u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Personality</h2></u><hr>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical overbearing perfectionist, caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being of his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them eventually led the other players in Kitagawa Daiichi to nickname him the "King of the Court", a constant reminder of the oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior high.

        Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and acquaintances, however, he is much more sensitive and childish than he appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration, and hence expresses his thoughts and emotions in an inappropriate way. After everyone in Kitagawa Daiichi became fed up with him and abandoned his side, Kageyama was filled with genuine regret and developed an intense fear of being despised and mistrusted, but refused to openly discuss his problem until Tsukishima confronted him about it.
        
        Despite his inability to properly socialize, he sincerely wishes to do his best and is extremely passionate and dedicated when it comes to volleyball, to the point where he gets overly excited about nearly every successful move he pulls off with Hinata.
        
        Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of his upperclassmen, as well as more accepting of people whose abilities and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so much. Additionally, this has also helped him regain his confidence as a setter. He has also come to realize that he doesn't call the shots on the court, and has learned to give up control to Hinata and other spikers.
        
        During high school, he still gets extremely angry when he is called by his nickname, "King of the Court", but, by the Final Arc, he has changed greatly on how he views the nickname.</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">

            2."No matter how challenging the volley, there's only one reason why we chase the ball...there's only one reason we continue fighting. Because we haven't lost yet!" (To himself, Volume 1 Chapter 1 / Season 1 Episode 1) <br><br>
            3."Only the winners get to stay on the court. Only the best. If you want to win, then get stronger! Get Better!" (To Hinata, Volume 3 Chapter 23 / Season 1 Episode 10) <br><br>
            4."I want to be in the game. [I want to stay here longer. I want to stay with these guys.] Give me the thrill of the court. [I want to fight with these guys longer.] Let me feel out of breath. [Let me stand here.] I want to touch the ball. I want to fight. [I want to throw up a toss with my own hands over and over.] Then, we'll (Karasuno) win the match that's right in front of us!" (Kageyama and Sugawara's dual monologue, Volume 7 Chapter 57 / Season 1 Episode 21) <br><br>
            5."That does it. I'm not apologizing anymore. I'm never gonna put the ball up in such a sorry way... that I have to apologize for it ever again!" (To Hinata, Volume 8 Chapter 70 / Season 1 Episode 25) <br><br>

        <u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Plot</h2></u><hr>
        <div class="flex">
        <p style="font-size: large;">Kageyama makes his debut appearance during the middle school volleyball tournament when he arrives at the gym with his team, Kitagawa Daiichi Junior High. Its first match was against Hinata's team, Yukigaoka Junior High School. Before the game began, Kageyama went to the bathroom, where he encountered Hinata being bullied by members from Kitagawa Daiichi. Kageyama coldly criticized them before turning his attention to Hinata. Despite Kageyama's mocking of Hinata's lack of height and overly idealistic ambition, Hinata wasn't fazed and challenged Kageyama instead, surprising and irritating the latter. Kageyama accepted angrily before leaving.

            As expected, Kitagawa Daiichi easily overwhelmed Yukigaoka, but Hinata remained determined. Kageyama admired Hinata's high jumps, overall athletic abilities, and determination, but didn't change his poor opinion of the wing spiker. In the end, Kitagawa Daiichi won both sets (25-5, 25-8). As the teams lined up, Kageyama angrily asked Hinata what he had been doing for the past three years before getting called away. Afterward, as they were leaving, Hinata ran up to Kageyama and vowed to defeat him next time they faced each other.
            
            Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
            
            Hinata and Kageyama encounter each other again at Karasuno.
            
            Kageyama arrives at the second gymnasium early and practices serves[3]. Suddenly, the door slams open and Hinata rushes in, loudly asking Kageyama why he’s here too. Kageyama recognizes Hinata but doesn’t remember his name, prompting the latter to reintroduce himself. Hinata states that Kageyama has probably already forgotten him, but Kageyama denies it, thinking back to Hinata’s reflexes, jumping power, and speed. Kageyama instead insults Hinata, leading to an argument. Hinata asks Kageyama why he’s here and Kageyama reveals solemnly that he didn’t get into the best school in the prefecture. Hinata wonders how since Kageyama’s the King of the Upper Court and Kageyama yells at Hinata before getting interrupted by the third years.
            
            Daichi, Sugawara, and Tanaka are walking in while talking about Kageyama. They greet Kageyama and talk to him a bit. Hinata loudly greets the third years and Tanaka, taking the attention of Kageyama momentarily. They compliment Hinata for his performance last year and he exclaims that he’ll become Karasuno’s ace. This causes Kageyama to insult him, reminding him to not waste another three years again. Daichi tries to stop the argument but the first years ignore him, too engrossed in their fight.
            
            The vice-principal then comes in and the upperclassmen try to cover up the situation, but Hinata and Kageyama end up challenging each other to a mini-match. Hinata exclaims that he’s not the same as last year and Kageyama replies with the same words and smiles excitedly, surprising Hinata.
            
            The match begins and Kageyama does a jump serve that Hinata avoids at the last moment. Kageyama asks if this behavior is any different from last year’s and Hinata asks for another try without any hesitation. Kageyama serves again but to his surprise, Hinata moves quickly to where the ball goes. However, the ball bounces off his arms and then his face before flying towards the vice principal. It knocks the vice principal’s wig off, silencing everyone in the gym. Coldly, the vice principal asks Daichi to go outside for small talk as Kageyama and Hinata watch on.
            
            
            Hinata and Kageyama are kicked out of the gym.
            
            When Daichi returns, he rounds everyone up and begins lecturing the first years before getting cut off by Kageyama. The setter criticizes Hinata and blames him for everything and Daichi interjects coldly. He explains Karasuno’s goals to go to Nationals before asserting that he doesn’t want any players on his team who would fight with one another. He then throws the two first years out. They aren’t allowed to join until they begin to view each other as teammates.
            
            Hinata begs to be let back in while Kageyama stays silent initially. After coming to terms with his situation, he pushes Hinata aside as he claims that he’ll be able to work with the latter. Daichi opens the door and asks if he’s sure. However, Kageyama replies sheepishly that with Hinata’s current skill level, he would rather take on all the roles by himself than work with Hinata. Daichi laughs and asks Kageyama how he would be able to do that in a game where teamwork is so essential.
            
            The two remain outside the gym. After a while, Kageyama storms away, wondering what he would do since he can't see Hinata as a teammate. He announces arrogantly that he has the potential to make Karasuno better so he has to be allowed on the team. He then proposes to challenge the upperclassmen to a 2-on-2 match. He adds that he doesn’t want to be on the same team as Hinata, but they have to cooperate to join. Hinata agrees after thinking it over.
            
            3-on-3 First Years Match
            Later on in the evening, as the Karasuno members are cleaning up, Hinata and Kageyama announce their challenge. Secretly, Kageyama still refuses to work with Hinata and may have been planning on winning the game with serves and dump shots only. Daichi sternly asks them if they had considered the possibility of them losing and Kageyama replies that they’ll take any punishment.
            
            Daichi agrees and changes the match to a 3-on-3 with the duo against the other two first years. Tanaka is placed on the duo’s team while Daichi joins the other one. However, if the duo loses, as long as the third years are around, Kageyama will never get to play as the setter. A shocked Kageyama tries to reason as Daichi reminds him of his selfish behavior from junior high. Despite Daichi telling him that he can join the club as another type of player, Kageyama exclaims that he is a setter only. Daichi replies that it’ll be okay as long as Kageyama wins, and the latter accepts begrudgingly.
            
            Kageyama leaves angrily with Hinata trailing behind him. The latter remarks that even if Kageyama isn’t the setter, he’ll be able to play as a regular anyway and exclaims that spikers are cooler than setters anyway. </p>
