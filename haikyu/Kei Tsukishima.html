            <u><h2 style="color: coral;"> About</h2></u><hr>

            <p style="font-size: larger;"> Kei Tsukishima (月島 蛍, Tsukishima Kei) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and a middle
                blocker. He is Karasuno's tallest player and known for being a calm and clever blocker, forming an
                important part of Karasuno's defense. His simultaneously polite yet condescending attitude often angers
                both his own teammates (usually Tobio Kageyama and Shoyo Hinata) and opposing teams. Tsukishima often
                thanks other players cheerfully when they make snide remarks to his face. Despite his apparent arrogance
                and scornful attitude, Tsukishima actually has an inferiority complex and hates "elite players" like
                Kageyama; during the team's formation, he only refers to Kageyama as "The King" or "Your Highness" to
                anger him and draw out his tyrannical personality. Tsukishima is the only team member to question his
                devotion to volleyball, due in part to past personal experiences. His closest friend is Tadashi
                Yamaguchi, who refers to him by the nickname "Tsukki". Despite his apparent indifference towards him,
                Tsukishima trusts in his abilities and is proud of his improvements. As a player, he is noted to be the
                complete opposite of Hinata, who in contrast is short, energetic, and acts instinctually. Currently, he
                works at the Sendai city museum and plays for Sendai's local team.</p>
                <u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Personality</h2></u><hr>
                <p style="font-size: larger;">Tsukishima is very blunt and will sometimes rile his teammates up due to his antagonistic nature (most notably being Hinata, Kageyama, Nishinoya, and Tanaka) and sometimes other teams because of his casual smug attitude, taking pride in and relishing when his opponents see him as a nuisance as seen with Tendō and Shirabu.

                    Whenever someone does or says something stupid or silly he is usually seen snickering in the background. However, he does seem to be intimidated by his seniors, being nowhere in sight when Daichi reprimands Tanaka for antagonizing Aoba Josai even though he did so as well, or backing down whenever Ennoshita calls him out.
                    
                    Despite coming across as arrogant, Tsukishima has low self-esteem and thinks of himself as inferior. This is first noted to be a surprise by Kuroo, who accidentally riles him up by suggesting he’ll lose to Hinata, to which he says that he’s already below him. After the Shiratorizawa match, despite being the MVP, he’s seen calling himself lame for only being able to block Ushijima’s spikes once, only adding to how little he believes in himself and his achievements.
                    
                    Although Tsukishima maintains a persona of someone who shows little interest in anything and wouldn't do something he didn't like or enjoy, he does truly enjoy volleyball. He initially refrained from putting too much effort into volleyball and being too passionate about it out of fear of suffering from the same fate as his brother. However, after his confrontation with Yamaguchi and hearing Bokuto's inspirational words in the Tokyo training camp, he started to take the sport more seriously and finally found his passion and motivation for volleyball when he blocked Ushijima.
                    
                    Tsukishima keeps his cool, for the most part, but he can be seen getting visibly annoyed when people underestimate him or tell him what he can or can not do, and uses it as motivation to prove them wrong. He also says things like "It's not a competition" with Hinata but then immediately proceeds to do something to make him jealous, such as the time difference attack during the Shiratorizawa match.
                    
                    According to Akiteru, "Kei is blunt and doesn't show his emotions often, but he is actually a very hardworking and kind boy."</p>

                           1. "We're not hung up on winning or losing, so if it'll be troublesome for you guys to lose... how about we throw the game for you?" (To Kageyama and Hinata, Season 1 Episode 3) <br><br>
                           2. "...Uselessly hot-blooded people irritate me..." (To Yamaguchi, Season 1 Episode 3) <br><br>
                            3."You aren’t the only one who’s thinking out there. What the opponent’s defense looks like and how it’s reacting. Which shots are working and which aren’t. All of us think about that." (To Kageyama, Volume 7 Chapter 59) <br><br>
                            4."It’s not like I’m competing with him in the first place." (To Yamaguchi, about Hinata, Volume 19 Chapter 171) <br><br>
                            5."God, what's gotten into me? This is stupid. I'm not Hinata. Why do I feel like I want to keep fighting to the end?" (To himself, Volume 21 Chapter 184) <br><br>
                            6."Roofing someone certainly feels good, yes, but personally, I despise the idea of blockers getting around me even more. Settling down and following the ball means slower reaction times, yes, but that way setters will never shake you completely." (To Lev, Volume 21 Chapter 187)</p>

                            <p style="font-size: larger;">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
                                3-on-3 First Years Match
                                Tsukishima and Yamaguchi join Karasuno Boys’ Volleyball Club a few days after it begins for the new school year[2]. That evening, they go to where Hinata and Kageyama are practicing. To mess with Hinata, Tsukishima goes behind him and grabs the ball before Hinata can catch it and asks if the two are the first years who caused problems. When Hinata tries to reach for his ball, Tsukishima adds that elementary school kids should be going home, annoying Hinata.
                                
                                Kageyama cuts in and asks how tall Tsukishima is, though Yamaguchi answers for him. Tsukishima then points out Kageyama’s junior high and wonders what an “elite” is doing at Karasuno. Hinata calls for Tsukishima’s attention again and declares that they aren’t going to lose the 3-on-3 and Tsukishima simply shrugs it off, surprising Hinata. Lightheartedly, Tsukishima explains that the match isn’t important for him and Yamaguchi so they could just throw the game for them if they want.
                                
                                
                                Kageyama gets angry at Tsukishima's taunts.
                                
                                Angered, Kageyama replies that no matter what Tsukishima does, he would still win. In return, Tsukishima laughs at his confidence and reminds him of his “King” nickname. As Kageyama tries to retort, Tsukishima continues bringing up his past and remarks that it’s true Kageyama dislikes his nickname. Kageyama has had enough when Tsukishima brings up his performance during the prefecture semifinals last year and lunges forward, grabbing Tsukishima by the collar.
                                
                                After a few seconds, Kageyama lets go and simply walks away, causing Tsukishima to mock him even more. Suddenly, Hinata jumps up behind him and grabs the ball out of his hand, shocking him. As he lands, Hinata exclaims that he will defeat Tsukishima. Losing his composure for a second, Tsukishima glares at him, but quickly recovers and frivolously states that they should just have fun since volleyball is just a club anyway. He then walks away, leaving a confused Hinata staring after him.
                                
                                On the way home, Yamaguchi runs to Tsukishima and asks him what’s wrong since he seems to be brooding. Coldly, Tsukishima replies that he hates uselessly hot-blooded people like Kageyama and Hinata.
                                
                                On the day of the 3-on-3, as the players are warming up, Tsukishima loudly provokes Kageyama and Hinata to make them lose their composure, prompting Daichi to comment that Tsukishima has a bad personality.
                                
                                At first, Tsukishima easily blocks Hinata’s spikes due to his height advantage and makes a point of emphasizing that and Kageyama’s past. While Kageyama does his best to ignore him, Hinata gets angry and confronts Tsukishima, who reveals that Kageyama is only called a King because of his horrible attitude towards his former teammates.
                                
                                
                                Tsukishima mocks Hinata's lack of height.
                                
                                To his surprise, Kageyama responds that he is actually terrified of tossing the ball and not seeing anyone behind him like what had happened in junior high. Hinata quickly jumps in and adds that he doesn’t care about Kageyama’s past and will hit any ball Kageyama sends to him. Annoyed, Tsukishima replies that Hinata’s genuine straightforwardness irritates him and reminds Hinata that he can’t fill the gap in height with fighting spirit.
                                
                                
                                Tsukishima starts playing seriously.
                                
                                Throughout the game, Tsukishima continues with his taunts, reminding Hinata that he can’t just accomplish anything he wants just by putting all his effort into it. Hinata acknowledges that, but responds that he still wants to win with his body. As Tsukishima adds that his height is still an obstacle, Kageyama cuts in and states that as a setter, he will clear the path for Hinata[3].
                                
                                When Hinata and Kageyama pull off their first planned quick, Tsukishima’s shocked to discover that Hinata had his eyes closed and asks Daichi to explain it. After the two fail their next tries, Tsukishima wonders how long they’re going to keep trying until they give up. Daichi adds that it’s hard to see someone trusting someone else so completely, especially a rival.
                                
                                The next try, Tsukishima states to Kageyama that he should stop tossing to Hinata since it’ll always fail. However, he’s unnerved to see Hinata run up to Kageyama and quickly calls Yamaguchi over, leaving Daichi in the back. Hinata spikes successfully and scores.
                                
                                In the end, Tsukishima’s team loses. After the match, Hinata goes to Tsukishima and holds out his hand, seemingly asking to make up because the upperclassmen will kick out any members who don’t get along with others. Tsukishima ignores the hand and retorts that he only got kicked out because he ignored the upperclassmen and caused chaos.
                                
                                After Hinata leaves Tsukishima, Daichi approaches him and asks him what he thought of the match. Tsukishima replies that he didn’t really care and knew he would lose since he was against Kageyama. Daichi grins and points out that Tsukishima still got pretty serious during the game.
                                
                                At that moment, Kiyoko walks in with the team jackets. At first, Tsukishima doesn’t want to put it on, but Tanaka and Sugawara goad him into wearing it. Lining up, the first years stand in front of the upperclassmen with their jackets on and officially get welcomed into Karasuno Boys’ Volleyball Club.
                                
                                Aoba Johsai Practice Match
                                
                                Tsukishima and his teammates intimidate the Aoba Johsai players.
                                
                                Upon their arrival at Aoba Johsai High, Tsukishima, Yamaguchi, Tanaka, and Kageyama overhear two members of Aoba Jōhsai, Yahaba and Kindaichi, badmouthing Karasuno. Tanaka and Tsukishima join forces to intimidate the two Aoba Johsai players before Daichi arrives to reprimand them[4].
                                
                                Later during the match, Tsukishima is seen mocking Kageyama and Hinata after Hinata struck Kageyama on the back of his head with a serve. It's apparent that Tsukishima is still unable to get along with the his fellow first years, especially Kageyama. The two nearly get into an argument in the midst of a game after they started exchanging insults. Amazingly, they end up in-sync and put up a strong block after growing competitive toward each other. After their successful block, Tsukishima and Kageyama end up arguing over whose hand stopped the spike until Daichi angrily shouts at them to stop[5].
                                
                                Towards the end of the match, the coach of Aoba Johsai, Irihata, describes Tsukishima as a clever blocker, despite being somewhat lacking in drive. When Oikawa, Aoba Johsai’s captain and setter, arrives to pinch serve for their team, Tsukishima is targeted specifically for his weakness in receives[6]. He grows frustrated after continuously failing to receive Oikawa's serve. He becomes even more annoyed when Hinata stands up for him and gives him a speech about being allies. Afterwards, Tsukishima finally makes a save off of Oikawa's serve but ends up sending a free ball back to Aoba Johsai. However, his efforts ultimately gives his team a fighting chance, and they are able to capitalize on it to win the match.
                                
                                Later when Karasuno is leaving, Oikawa stops them and point out Tsukishima and Hinata's need to work on their receives. He is shown to be uncooperative when Hinata proclaims that they will be doing special training[7].
                                
                                Asahi and Nishinoya's Return
                                Nekoma Practice Match
                                When seeing Hinata and Kageyama racing over who would get to the bath first, Tsukishima mocks them for their behavior. Tsukishima takes part in the practice match between Karasuno and Nekoma as one of the starting players. Halfway into the first set, he is able to score when he uses a feint shot over Nekoma's block. This immediately catches Kenma's attention when he notices that Tsukishima is the opposite of Hinata in which he first thinks things through before taking action. Tsukishima's careful and attentive nature was soon proven when Kenma confirmed the middle blocker was studying him by using a decoy glance to trick him to go one direction only to set to the opposite side.
                                
                                As the match progresses, Hinata ends up getting blocked by Inuoka multiple times. Seeing another instance of this, Tsukishima subtly eyes Ukai to tell him that Hinata should get subbed out. However, the coach wants Hinata to learn to adapt on his own. Despite Tanaka and Asahi being supportive of Hinata trying to discover new techniques in the middle of a game, Tsukishima tells him to stop slacking off and threatens to get him benched. Near the end of the second set, Tsukishima is able to block Inuoka cleanly, which leaves the spectators impressed.
                                
                                After the practice match, Tsukishima observes Hinata and Inuoka jumping about and babbling in gibberish. When he remarks on their choice of language, Kuroo agrees that they are talking like children before suggesting that Tsukishima should let loose every so often instead of acting stoic all the time, to which Tsukishima replies that acting childish is not his style.</p>
