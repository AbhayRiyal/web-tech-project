    <u><h2 style="color: coral;"> About</h2></u><hr>
    <P style="font-size: large;">Shoyo Hinata (日向 翔陽, Hinata Shōyō) is a first-year student at Karasuno High School and is the protagonist. He was
        initially a wing spiker in Junior High but is currently a middle spiker. His jersey number is #10, which the
        Little Giant, the former Karasuno ace and Shoyo's idol, also wore. His speed and incredible vertical jump allow
        him to act as a decoy to trick opposing teams and grant leeway to Karasuno's attackers, gaining him the nickname
        "the greatest decoy." Though he originally aspires to become the ace, he grows to learn and embrace the
        importance of his role. Hinata is extremely cheerful, boisterous, and optimistic. Despite his small size,
        clumsiness, and lack of fundamental skills, he earns a spot on the regular lineup due to his extraordinary
        stamina, reflexes, and vertical jump. He plays exceptionally well when partnered with Tobio Kageyama as his
        setter, and the two quickly gain notoriety among other teams for their "freak quick" move, where Hinata jumps
        before (as opposed to during or after) the toss, then Kageyama quickly and accurately sets the ball to the exact
        pinnacle of Hinata's jump. Hinata is incredibly devoted to volleyball and practices tirelessly, leading to his
        rapid growth as a player. For the rest of his high school years, he redeems Karasuno's fallen honor with the
        help of the other Karasuno first years. After high school, he went to Brazil to train further in beach and
        indoor volleyball. Hinata currently plays for the MSBY Black Jackals, along with Fukurodani's Kōtarō Bokuto,
        Inarizaki's Atsumu Miya, and Itachiyama's Kiyoomi Sakusa. He achieved his goal of beating Kageyama in an
        official game, with the defeat of the Schweiden Adlers in the match between the two teams. The two play together
        for Japan's National Team (in the future).</P>
       <u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Personality</h2></u><hr>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Hinata has a cheerful and energetic personality. He is easily excited and can be quite loud, a trait second only to Nishinoya and Tanaka. For the most part, Hinata is very simple-minded which sometimes causes him to make rash decisions. However, he is also shown to be quite observant. He is capable of reading social cues and be incredibly empathetic toward others' struggles. As such, he often says just what others need to hear to push themselves in the right direction. He is also noted to be a natural schmoozer, a quality that his teammates occasionally use to win someone over; such as when Nishinoya agreed to help with Hinata's receives after being flattered by the first-year. His friendly and straightforward personality allows him to befriend even the quietest of people effortlessly, such as Kenma from Nekoma High and Aone from Date Tech High.

            However, despite his generally bubbly exterior, Hinata is also shown to have a serious attitude, particularly when it comes to volleyball. His intense love for the sport is demonstrated through his impressive display of tenacity stemming from his constant desire to improve his abilities. As stated by Sugawara, Hinata plays with great fortitude in the face of adversity and thus doesn't give up easily during a match[1]. Hinata can also exhibit a very intimidating expression when people underestimate him or speak poorly of his team. Still, Hinata gets scared easily, especially by larger and stronger opponents. This prompts him to develop the habit of hiding behind his nearest teammate. However, he recovers quickly before confidently challenging their opponents.
            
            In the beginning, Hinata is easily agitated before a match due to his lack of experience. He becomes so nervous that he would have an upset stomach or need to go to the toilet constantly. He also becomes clumsy as he would mess up his spikes or receives. Before Karasuno's first practice match against Aoba Johsai High, Hinata is so affected that he mistook Daichi and Kiyoko's attempt to comfort him as more pressure and short-circuited[2]. He only recovers after royally messing up and driving a serve into the back of Kageyama's head. Over time, Hinata becomes more apt at handling the pressure. Although still faint-hearted, Hinata has a considerably less severe reaction and can perform well during matches regardless.
            
            Hinata, like Kageyama, does poorly in school since he, too, is preoccupied with volleyball. He once told Sugawara that ever since he'd entered high school, he had never scored in the double digits on any of his tests[3].</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
                Entering Karasuno
                Hinata and Kageyama encounter.png
                Hinata races through the hallway in Karasuno High School to the gym, excited to start practicing and determined to get revenge on his opponent from junior high, Kageyama. However, as soon as he enters the gym, he finds that Kageyama is already there. The setter insults Hinata as soon as he recognizes him but before a full-scale fight can start, the Karasuno third years enter the gym. Tanaka recognizes Hinata as “that number 1 shorty” and compliments him. Hinata exclaims that he will become Karasuno’s ace, causing Kageyama to insult him again, leading to an argument. The vice-principal enters the gym to check out the ruckus and despite Tanaka’s efforts to get the first-years to stop, they start their 1-on-1 match against each other. Kageyama serves to Hinata but it flies past the latter’s face. The second time, to Kageyama’s shock, Hinata manages to receive the ball but it bounces off him and hits the vice-principal across the face, causing his wig to fly off his head and onto Daichi's. The vice-principal then takes Daichi outside to talk and after coming back, Daichi tells the two first years of Karasuno’s past and his desire to get the team to nationals. However, he can’t accept anyone who can cause trouble for the team, no matter how skilled or determined they are. To the first years’ shock, Daichi then throws them out of the gym, saying that until they view each other as teammates, they are not allowed to participate in club activities[6].
                
                HinataKageyama2.png
                Out of desperation, Hinata starts begging but nothing works until Kageyama decides to challenge the third years to a 2-on-2 match. Hinata disagrees with the idea at first but after Kageyama reminds him of his past, Hinata starts to change his mind. He tells Kageyama that he has to get into the club because if he wants to beat Kageyama one day, he needs to practice.
                
                3-on-3 First Years Match
                Later on in the evening, as the Karasuno members are cleaning up, Hinata and Kageyama ask the third years for a match. However, Daichi changes it to a 3-on-3 match against the other first years and has Tanaka play with Hinata and Kageyama. The conditions are that if the two first years lose, Kageyama will not be allowed to play as a setter as long as the third years are still around. Hinata tries catching the captain’s attention, feeling left out since he didn't receive a punishment, but fails. The two first years eventually agree to the terms and leave. As he's walking away, Hinata tells Kageyama happily that it's okay if he isn’t the setter because he will still be able to become a regular and wing spikers are cooler than setters anyway; this angers Kageyama and leads to an argument about whether setters or spikers are cooler. As they're talking, Kageyama thinks about how they're going to practice and Tanaka catches their attention from inside the gym. He discreetly tells them that the gym will be opened before 7 am the next day, and the two first years decide to come at 5 am.
                
                The next day, Hinata and Kageyama arrive at the gym only to find it locked. At that very moment, Tanaka arrives with the key and to their delight, decides to help them practice. Hinata enters the gym excitedly, remembering how the Small Giant had once practiced there. He thinks happily that compared to junior high, he now has a net to use and a setter to play with, no matter what kind of personality the latter has.
                
                They start practicing but can’t seem to sync at all and soon end up fighting. Suddenly, they're interrupted by Sugawara’s arrival, but the third year agrees to keep their secret and helps them practice as well. Sugawara ends up helping Hinata with his receives while Kageyama practices with Tanaka, but Hinata isn’t satisfied. Hinata decides to approach Kageyama and asks him to toss to him but Kageyama flat out refuses, stating that Hinata's too slow. To Hinata’s anger, Kageyama tells him that all Hinata should do on Saturday is to try his best not to drag the team down. Hinata asks him whether he will toss to him if he can receive the ball in a way that satisfies Kageyama, and Kageyama replies that he will toss to Hinata only if it's necessary; however, he doesn’t think Hinata's necessary to help him win[7].
                
                Later on, during a break in class, Hinata goes outside to practice with Sugawara. As they're talking, Hinata reveals to Sugawara that during junior high, he didn’t have a setter and had to ask his friends to toss to him. However, he didn’t give up and practiced with the mothers club and the girls’ club’s setters, but he could never consider them as teammates. When he went to high school, he was excited to see what kind of setter he would have, but it turned out to be Kageyama. Sugawara tells Hinata that he will set to him from now on, but Hinata replies sullenly that it will feel like he lost to Kageyama. Sugawara asks Hinata if he came to Karasuno just so he could defeat Kageyama, and Hinata replies that he wants to become as strong as someone who can beat Kageyama; this will allow him to play against other strong opponents on equal footing. He doesn’t want to lose anymore. Sugawara states that even though Hinata views Kageyama as the strongest player and enemy, he is currently Hinata’s strongest ally.
                
                A few days later, Kageyama starts practicing with Hinata for real. One day, Kageyama pushes Hinata to his limits, but the latter refuses to give up, stating that the ball hasn’t fallen yet. Kageyama spikes a ball too hard and it flies to the back of the gym, but Hinata chases after it with all his might. This inspires Kageyama to finally toss to Hinata and despite being at his limits, Hinata spikes it happily. Kageyama then approaches him and says that they will win on Saturday, showing his acceptance of Hinata as a teammate. Hinata tries to reply but throws up instead.
                
                
                Hinata and Kageyama meet Tsukishima and Yamaguchi.
                
                A while later, Kageyama and Hinata are practicing outside and Hinata contemplates happily how he finally got Kageyama to toss to him[8]. Kageyama suddenly hits the ball up the tree and Hinata has to get it down. Angrily, Hinata calls Kageyama a “damn King”, annoying the latter, but Hinata doesn’t understand why because he views “King” as a cool nickname. The two continue practicing into the night until they're interrupted by Tsukishima and Yamaguchi. Tsukishima teases Hinata, angering him. Hinata exclaims that he won’t lose to Tsukishima in the match. The taller boy then asks Hinata if he wants him to just throw the game. He soon turns his attention to Kageyama and teases him about his nickname and past. Hinata watches on, confused as to why Kageyama isn’t reiterating. He then decides to take things into his own hands when Kageyama starts walking away. As Tsukishima throws the volleyball into the air, Hinata jumps up from behind him and grabs it, exclaiming that he's going to hit the ball above Tsukishima’s head in the game. Tsukishima soon leaves and Hinata angrily tells Kageyama that they're going to beat up Tsukishima, but Kageyama brushes him off coolly.
                
                The next day, the match starts with Hinata, Tanaka, and Kageyama vs Tsukishima, Yamaguchi, and Daichi. Hinata is shocked at first because Daichi's on the other team, but he quickly gets over it. Right after the match starts, Kageyama tosses to Hinata and he spikes it, his high jump shocking everyone in the gym, but it's immediately blocked by Tsukishima. Hinata reassures himself that even if the opponent is huge, he’s only one person. Hinata can get it through next time. However, Tsukishima keeps blocking his spikes.
                
                Tsukishima teases Kageyama about his past, and Kageyama replies sullenly that tossing the ball only for no one to be there frightens him. Hinata interrupts him, stating nonchalantly that that situation was back in junior high. Kageyama tossed the ball properly to Hinata, so the latter doesn’t care about the setter’s past.
                
                The next move, Kageyama was going to toss to Tanaka but Hinata suddenly appears behind him, asking for a toss. He barely hits the ball past the net. He then turns to Kageyama, yelling that he is here now. No matter what happened in junior high, Hinata wants to hit Kageyama’s tosses. He will jump anywhere and hit any kind of ball, so Kageyama has to keep tossing to Hinata.
