            <p class="paragraph">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
                Entering Karasuno

                Hinata races through the hallway in Karasuno High School to the gym, excited to start practicing and
                determined
                to get revenge on his opponent from junior high, Kageyama. However, as soon as he enters the gym, he
                finds that
                Kageyama is already there. The setter insults Hinata as soon as he recognizes him but before a
                full-scale fight
                can start, the Karasuno third years enter the gym. Tanaka recognizes Hinata as “that number 1 shorty”
                and
                compliments him. Hinata exclaims that he will become Karasuno’s ace, causing Kageyama to insult him
                again,
                leading to an argument. The vice-principal enters the gym to check out the ruckus and despite Tanaka’s
                efforts
                to get the first-years to stop, they start their 1-on-1 match against each other. Kageyama serves to
                Hinata but
                it flies past the latter’s face. The second time, to Kageyama’s shock, Hinata manages to receive the
                ball but it
                bounces off him and hits the vice-principal across the face, causing his wig to fly off his head and
                onto
                Daichi's. The vice-principal then takes Daichi outside to talk and after coming back, Daichi tells the
                two first
                years of Karasuno’s past and his desire to get the team to nationals. However, he can’t accept anyone
                who can
                cause trouble for the team, no matter how skilled or determined they are. To the first years’ shock,
                Daichi then
                throws them out of the gym, saying that until they view each other as teammates, they are not allowed to
                participate in club activities[6].

                Out of desperation, Hinata starts begging but nothing works until Kageyama decides to challenge the
                third years
                to a 2-on-2 match. Hinata disagrees with the idea at first but after Kageyama reminds him of his past,
                Hinata
                starts to change his mind. He tells Kageyama that he has to get into the club because if he wants to
                beat
                Kageyama one day, he needs to practice.

                3-on-3 First Years Match
                Later on in the evening, as the Karasuno members are cleaning up, Hinata and Kageyama ask the third
                years for a
                match. However, Daichi changes it to a 3-on-3 match against the other first years and has Tanaka play
                with
                Hinata and Kageyama. The conditions are that if the two first years lose, Kageyama will not be allowed
                to play
                as a setter as long as the third years are still around. Hinata tries catching the captain’s attention,
                feeling
                left out since he didn't receive a punishment, but fails. The two first years eventually agree to the
                terms and
                leave. As he's walking away, Hinata tells Kageyama happily that it's okay if he isn’t the setter because
                he will
                still be able to become a regular and wing spikers are cooler than setters anyway; this angers Kageyama
                and
                leads to an argument about whether setters or spikers are cooler. As they're talking, Kageyama thinks
                about how
                they're going to practice and Tanaka catches their attention from inside the gym. He discreetly tells
                them that
                the gym will be opened before 7 am the next day, and the two first years decide to come at 5 am.

                The next day, Hinata and Kageyama arrive at the gym only to find it locked. At that very moment, Tanaka
                arrives
                with the key and to their delight, decides to help them practice. Hinata enters the gym excitedly,
                remembering
                how the Small Giant had once practiced there. He thinks happily that compared to junior high, he now has
                a net
                to use and a setter to play with, no matter what kind of personality the latter has.

                They start practicing but can’t seem to sync at all and soon end up fighting. Suddenly, they're
                interrupted by
                Sugawara’s arrival, but the third year agrees to keep their secret and helps them practice as well.
                Sugawara
                ends up helping Hinata with his receives while Kageyama practices with Tanaka, but Hinata isn’t
                satisfied.
                Hinata decides to approach Kageyama and asks him to toss to him but Kageyama flat out refuses, stating
                that
                Hinata's too slow. To Hinata’s anger, Kageyama tells him that all Hinata should do on Saturday is to try
                his
                best not to drag the team down. Hinata asks him whether he will toss to him if he can receive the ball
                in a way
                that satisfies Kageyama, and Kageyama replies that he will toss to Hinata only if it's necessary;
                however, he
                doesn’t think Hinata's necessary to help him win[7].

                Later on, during a break in class, Hinata goes outside to practice with Sugawara. As they're talking,
                Hinata
                reveals to Sugawara that during junior high, he didn’t have a setter and had to ask his friends to toss
                to him.
                However, he didn’t give up and practiced with the mothers club and the girls’ club’s setters, but he
                could never
                consider them as teammates. When he went to high school, he was excited to see what kind of setter he
                would
                have, but it turned out to be Kageyama. Sugawara tells Hinata that he will set to him from now on, but
                Hinata
                replies sullenly that it will feel like he lost to Kageyama. Sugawara asks Hinata if he came to Karasuno
                just so
                he could defeat Kageyama, and Hinata replies that he wants to become as strong as someone who can beat
                Kageyama;
                this will allow him to play against other strong opponents on equal footing. He doesn’t want to lose
                anymore.
                Sugawara states that even though Hinata views Kageyama as the strongest player and enemy, he is
                currently
                Hinata’s strongest ally.

                A few days later, Kageyama starts practicing with Hinata for real. One day, Kageyama pushes Hinata to
                his
                limits, but the latter refuses to give up, stating that the ball hasn’t fallen yet. Kageyama spikes a
                ball too
                hard and it flies to the back of the gym, but Hinata chases after it with all his might. This inspires
                Kageyama
                to finally toss to Hinata and despite being at his limits, Hinata spikes it happily. Kageyama then
                approaches
                him and says that they will win on Saturday, showing his acceptance of Hinata as a teammate. Hinata
                tries to
                reply but throws up instead.</big> </p> <br>
