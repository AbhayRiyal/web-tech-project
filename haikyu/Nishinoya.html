    <u><h2 style="color: coral;"> About</h2></u><hr>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Yū Nishinoya (西谷 夕, Nishinoya Yū) is a second-year student at Karasuno High School and the team's libero and defensive specialist. He is known as "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" due to his reliability in saving the ball and his high skill level. Along with Tobio Kageyama, he is considered one of Karasuno's two prodigies, having won the prefecture's "Best Libero" award in Junior High. Even shorter than Shoyo Hinata, he is the smallest player on Karasuno. Nishinoya is loud, energetic, and deeply passionate about his position, believing that he would choose to play libero even if he were born taller. He is considered the backbone of the team, as his specialization in receives and block recovery allowed the team to keep scoring and continue the rally. Nishinoya is very proud of (but usually ridiculed for) his signature move, "Rolling Thunder", merely a rolling receive where he shouted "rolling thunder". He had a close relationship with Asahi Azumane, refusing to play unless the latter returned to his role as the team's ace. He is usually with Ryūnosuke Tanaka, both of whom adored team manager Kiyoko Shimizu. He came from Chidoriyama middle school and was viewed as a very powerful player, shown when an opposing high school begins to talk about possible threats on the Karasuno team, mainly Nishinoya being an amazing libero. He is probably good enough to get into a powerhouse school but enrolled at Karasuno because he thought that the girl's uniforms were cute and that the boy's all-black gakuran looked cool. After the timeskip, he traveled the world.</p>
    <u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Personality</h2></u><hr>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Nishinoya is a very energetic and temperamental person. His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often goes badly for him. Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence to vent out his anger on certain occasions), he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.

        He has a quirky habit of spontaneously coming up with ridiculous names for the moves he executes while practicing receives. He is also unexpectedly shy when it comes to talking to girls he hasn't met before.
        
        Like Tanaka, Nishinoya has a large interest in the team manager, Kiyoko. Together, they try to approach her but are usually ignored. They cause a bit of a ruckus when this happens and are usually scolded by somebody, most often Daichi. When the series officially introduces Nishinoya, he energetically approaches Kiyoko, which results in an off-screen slap. Nishinoya returns with a red cheek and a smile[1]. Tanaka and Nishinoya both like being called "Senpai" (or Upperclassmen in the English version.) and dislike boys who have most of the attention from female admirers, like Oikawa.
        
        Nishinoya can be extremely impatient, excitable and impulsive. As Tanaka puts it, "he simply gets too fired up for his good.". He doesn't bother to filter his words and is therefore prone to blurting out whatever he's thinking in a loud and tactless manner. In-game, however, his attitude changes drastically as he becomes incredibly focused and serious, remaining calm and doing everything in his power to provide the support his team needs until the very end. For this reason, everyone in the volleyball club respects him greatly. He is shown to be incredibly hard-working, once even continuously practicing more than 200 spike-block receives to the point that his legs stopped moving.
        
        Although he displays an incredible feat of confidence and fearlessness countless times, Nishinoya admits that he was a "huge scaredy-cat" when he was a kid[2]. He had many fears, which resulted in his grandfather training him so he could overcome those fears, teaching him that behind every fear is a wasted experience, and telling him to never be afraid to ask for help whenever the fear doesn't fade. This reflected Nishinoya's tenacity and courageous façade during matches and served as an important matter in his character development sometime in the Nationals because he straightforwardly tells the team about his childhood without a doubt even though he is being pushed into a corner.</p>
        
            <u> <h2 style="color: coral;"">Quotes</h2></u><hr>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                1."Who cares how it sounds? If a spiker is able to score because of you, the decoy, then your position is just as important!" (To Hinata when the latter loses faith in his 'decoy' role, Volume 3 Chapter 17 / Season 1 Episode 8) <br><br>
                2."Kageyama, Tsukishima, Yamaguchi, get over here. I've got an important lecture to give you, so crouch down! No, wait, sit down! Get yourselves lower than my line of sight!" (To his underclassmen after he did his 'rolling thunder', Volume 3 Chapter 18 / Season 1 Episode 8) <br><br>
                3."Don't you DARE give up on the shots I've worked so hard to receive!! I'm a libero! A vital part of our team's formation! And yet, scoring points is impossible for me... I'm not allowed to attack. And I have no intention of blaming you, no matter how many of your spikes don't go through. But to just accept defeat so selfishly... That's something I cannot forgive!" (To Asahi, Volume 3 Chapter 20 / Season 1 Episode 9) <br><br>
                4."My role is to strictly 'connect' everyone. I can't fight in the sky -- that's the spikers' domain. But I will, without fail, get the ball to them at the highest point possible. No matter how many times it bounces back off a 'wall', if I can just get to it, then our ace will definitely score. The ball which has rebounded off the wall... just you watch! This time as well, I'll raise it up, so please, call out for a toss once more, ace!" (To Asahi, Volume 3 Chapter 20 / Season 1 Episode 9) <br><br>
                5."My hand's thickness is about 2 cm. Perhaps my hands are a lot smaller than those of other boys my age... But that 2 cm gap between the ball and the floor is the ace's lifeline!" (To himself, Volume 3 Chapter 21 / Season 1 Episode 10)</p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
            Aoba Johsai Practice Match
            While leaving Aoba Johsai High after their practice match, Daichi states that while they have little time left before the Interhigh preliminaries begin, it's about time for Karasuno's "Guardian Deity", Nishinoya, to return[7].
            
            Asahi and Nishinoya's Return
            On their way home, Hinata, Kageyama, Daichi, Sugawara, and Tanaka discuss the upcoming Interhigh competition and the vital positions they currently lack. Kageyama brings up the team member who's about to return and asks what he's been up to. Tanaka answers he was suspended for a week and was banned from club activities for a month which prompts Hinata to ask if he's a delinquent. But Tanaka says no and states that he's just a little too passionate but overly is a good guy. Tanaka adds that he was Karasuno's only prodigy, only that it is no longer the case now as Kageyama has joined their team. Sawamura tells Hinata to also call him "senpai" and claims it will make him stupidly happy.
            
            
            Nishinoya perfectly receives Kageyama's serve.
            
            While Kageyama is in the middle of serve practice, Nishinoya jumps in to intercept the ball and does a perfect serve receive which stuns Hinata and Kageyama. He compliments Kageyama's serve. Tanaka, Sugawara, and Sawamura arrive. Tanaka enthusiastically calls out to him which Nishinoya returns. Sawamura formally introduces him to the two first years[6].
            
            Hinata, amazed and a bit shocked, comments that Nishinoya is shorter than him which annoys the latter. Tanaka tries to calm Nishinoya down. When asked how tall he is, he answers he is 159 cm tall. He scolds Hinata about how being taller is not a big deal to get happy and cry about when Hinata sheds tears of joy upon meeting someone shorter than him since he started club activities.
            
            
            Nishinoya explains his reasons for choosing Karasuno.
            
            Nishinoya asks Kageyama, who he says has a mean look in his eyes, what junior high he is from. He loudly expresses his amazement when Kageyama answers he is from Kitagawa Daiichi, a powerhouse school, and tells he has played against them before and lost 2-1 and adds Kitagawa also had a guy with an amazing serve. Sugawara and Sawamura note Nishinoya's still boisterous behavior. Kageyama also asks Nishinoya what junior high is he from to which Nishinoya answers he is from Chidoriyama. Kageyama notes it's also a powerhouse and asks why he came to Karasuno. Nishinoya answers that it's because he likes the girls' uniform a lot, not to include the girls themselves who went beyond his expectations. He also adds that boys get to wear black gakuran, which for him is cool as he had to wear blazers in junior high which made him want to wear a gakuran really badly. He states that with these reasons plus Karasuno being close to his house, it was an easy decision to make.
            
            Nishinoya notices Kiyoko's arrival and rushes to meet her. Sugawara likens him to a storm, Hinata to an unexpected downpour. But Sawamura says his plays are surprisingly quiet. Nishinoya, now with a slap mark on his left face, asks if Asahi has come back. When Daichi answers no, he gets angry and calls Asahi a coward which Tanaka calls him out for. Nishinoya only retorts that a coward's a coward. He storms out of the gym saying if Asahi's not coming back, then neither is he. Hinata follows him outside and asks Nishinoya to teach him receives. Hinata asks if he's a libero, a defense specialist. Nishinoya asks if he thinks so because he is short. But Hinata says it's because he's good at receives and adds Daichi called him a "Guardian Deity". This flatters Nishinoya and asks if Daichi really called him that. Hinata affirms, flattering Nishinoya even further. Hinata requests Nishinoya to teach him receives and calls him senpai, effectively winning Nishinoya over, albeit Nishinoya clarifying it's only to teach him and that it doesn't mean he's coming back to the club.
            
            
            Nishinoya teaches the first years how to do receives.
            
            Later in the evening, Nishinoya instructs the first years on receives but Hinata, Tsukishima and Yamaguchi do not understand. Tanaka states it's because Nishinoya only moves on pure instinct. Daichi and Takeda converse about the position of libero and how it will be encouraging if Nishinoya comes back as their libero. Daichi notes how despite with his small body, Nishinoya's presence is overwhelming and gives them peace of mind.
            
            Hinata suddenly asks Nishinoya who Asahi is. Nishinoya answers he is Karasuno's ace, or should be. Hinata expresses his intention of becoming an ace, which Nishinoya finds awesome and cheers him on. But later adds he's nowhere near as promising as their current ace. Nishinoya ponders on the admirability of the "ace" and how just the sound of it already has a cool ring to it while "setter" and "libero" look plain. But he proudly claims that what excites the crowd the most is not an incredible spike but rather when they see a super receive. He adds that since volleyball is a battle of height, libero might be the only position where a short player can thrive but he did not become a libero because of his height. He states even if he were 2-meter tall, he'd still play as a libero as it is the libero who is best at ensuring that the ball does not touch the floor, even if it can't be spiked or blocked. Nishinoya's explanation amazes Hinata and calls it cool. This flutters Nishinoya again.
            
            Nishinoya then asks Hinata what his specialty is, to which the latter answers, in a down tone, he is the decoy. Nishinoya only cheers Hinata saying if someone's spike can succeed thanks to the decoy, then his role is just as important[3].
            
            
            Nishinoya calls out to their ace.
            
            A flashback shows Nishinoya digging a ball and pondering on the fact that his job is to keep the rally going as he can't fight in the sky which is the domain of spikers but he will, without fail, get the ball to the spikers at their highest point. Regardless of how many times a wall bounces back the spike, as long as he can get the ball through, the ace will score. Nishinoya asks Karasuno's ace to call out for a toss, one more time.
            
            At practice the next day, Nishinoya enthusiastically yells "Rolling Thunder" while receiving a ball, shocking Daichi and Tanaka into silence while Hinata looks on adoringly. Sawamura later compliments his receive. Tanaka laughs at his receive and asks where the "thunder" is as it's only a normal rolling receive. Sawamura scolds him and tells him not to move around while shouting something strange as it's dangerous. Kageyama, confused, asks why he had yelled. Tsukishima and Yamaguchi laugh. Nishinoya angrily orders the three to sit down so he can look down on them while he gives them a lecture. Hinata admiringly asks Nishinoya to teach him the move.
            
            Takeda arrives and notifies the team about the practice match against Nekoma High that he has arranged. Nishinoya approaches Sawamura and apologizes as he won't be participating in the practice match. He explains that despite wanting to practice with them if he were to participate in a match and win, it would be like proving that Karasuno can win without Asahi and he doesn't want it. Daichi approves but asks Nishinoya to at least join their training camp[8].
            
            The following day at practice, Tanaka asks Nishinoya what he did at his special training when he was banned. Nishinoya replies that he trained to receive balls that had been blocked and adds that he has yet to do it well but once he can do it properly, his teammates can spike without worry. Tanaka notes how Nishinoya seems to have new bruises every time he sees him and cries in his admiration, baffling Nishinoya.
            
            Coach Ukai temporarily joins Karasuno and arranges a practice match between Karasuno High and the Neighborhood Association Team. Nishinoya hesitates at the prospect of playing in a match, which Ukai notices. Sawamura tries to explain the situation but Ukai asks Nishinoya to participate as the libero of the Neighborhood Association. As Nishinoya rushes to join their visitors, Hinata suddenly shouts out Asahi's arrival, to which Nishinoya perks up. He looks on as Asahi enters the gymnasium. Sugawara joins the neighborhood team as setter and cheers Nishinoya to do some nice receives. Nishinoya answers naturally and glances at Asahi before going to the court[9].</p>
