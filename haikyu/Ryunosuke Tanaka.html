            <h2 style="color: coral;">About</h2><hr>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Ryūnosuke Tanaka (田中 龍之介, Tanaka Ryūnosuke) is a second-year student at
                Karasuno High School and a wing spiker. He is loud, fierce and aggressive, but deeply respects his
                seniors and looks out for his juniors, wanting to be a good senior for them. Tanaka is a talented and
                versatile spiker and often gets digs that keep the rally going. When playing, he displays amazing mental
                fortitude, even when he is targeted by the opposite team. Unfortunately, his aggressive behavior and
                delinquent-like appearance sometimes make a poor impression. Tanaka often tries to pick fights with
                other teams, which Daichi or Kōshi Sugawara must then break up. He is good friends with Yū Nishinoya,
                and they both adore their team manager. After the timeskip, he runs a Sports shop and is married to
                Kiyoko.</p>

           
            
            <h2 style="color: coral;"> Personality</h2><hr>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Loud, hot-headed, and easily angered, he is no stranger to picking fights. He
                is also somewhat of a slacker, shown by his less-than-stellar work ethic in school and his usual
                lateness to practices. Despite all this, he is shown to be caring and supportive of his teammates, and
                even protective of his underclassmen. Tanaka doesn't take kindly to people who belittle others, as shown
                when he grows upset at Kei Tsukishima for trash-talking others during their first 3-on-3 match. In
                addition, he gets very excited and is easily won over when an underclassman calls him "senpai".

                Once he gets fired up, he is usually unstoppable on the court and also uncontrollably loud, as
                demonstrated by his over-the-top cheering after he scores or pulls off an incredible move. He also has
                the tendency to take off his shirt and spin it over his head when he scores a point in practices.

                Tanaka is also someone with strong mental fortitude, not letting himself be brought down by things like
                being targeted or getting blocked during games. He seems to know that he can be an easy target to some
                people and has a lot to improve on, but instead of letting those things bother him he gets fired up and
                keeps trying no matter what. However, even for Tanaka, things can be too much and every six months or so
                he starts to think he is nothing but mediocre. But, he tells himself that thinking like that is just a
                waste of time.

                Tanaka has a large interest in girls, as shown in the numerous posters of female idols that are posted
                up in his room. One girl in particular who he has a large interest in is Kiyoko Shimizu. He often
                approaches her and tries to talk to her, though his advances are usually ignored, which he claims turns
                him on. Tanaka usually looks out for her, alongside Nishinoya, especially during the Tokyo training camp
                and official matches when other teams take an interest in her.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large;">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc

                Tanaka, Daichi, and Sugawara greet Hinata and Kageyama.

                Tanaka is first seen in the hallway with Daichi and Sugawara on the first day of school. As Kiyoko
                approaches them with the new members' registrations, Tanaka compliments her beauty, though she ignores
                him.

                At the end of the day, the three upperclassmen head down to the gym to begin practice and see Hinata and
                Kageyama already at the gym. Tanaka at first tries to intimidate the first years, especially Kageyama,
                whom he remembers as the conceited setter from Kitagawa Daiichi. Engrossed with this powerful addition
                to the team, the upperclassmen fail to notice Hinata until he calls out for their attention. Tanaka
                immediately recognizes him as "that number one shortie" and enthusiastically compliments him for his
                confident playing style, despite his clumsiness and lack of height. However, his good mood is ruined
                when Kageyama and Hinata start fighting, interrupting Daichi and catching the vice-principal's
                attention.

                Tanaka hastily tries to calm the first years down, but they ignore him and start their own mini-match.
                The match goes astray and the vice principal wounds up getting his wig knocked off. Tanaka starts
                laughing, though he tries to suppress it.


                Tanaka watches on fearfully as Daichi gives his speech.

                After Daichi speaks with the vice principal, Tanaka stands with the others and face him quietly, getting
                intimidated when he realizes that Daichi’s angry. As Daichi starts to explain Karasuno’s goals, Tanaka
                adds a complaint about their nicknames. He quickly gets annoyed at Kageyama when the latter notes that
                there are plenty of other teams with the same goals as Karasuno, but stops when he sees Daichi’s face.
                He remains quiet until Daichi kicks the two first years out. Listening to the two argue outside, Tanaka
                begins laughing again.

                3-on-3 First Years Match
                At the end of practice, Tanaka remarks to Sugawara that the two first-years may resort to challenging
                them to a match to win their admission and to his surprise, they actually do. Tanaka laughs at them
                right away, but refuses to team up with them. However, he’s easily convinced by Daichi to join them when
                the captain flatters the second-year about how he could be an asset to the two and he runs to the
                first-years enthusiastically, even hinting to them later on to meet up early in the morning the next day
                to practice.

                The next morning, Tanaka arrives at five am and greets the two first-years waiting outside the gym. He
                shows them the key and loudly tells them to call him senpai. As he unlocks the gym, he thinks back to
                Daichi’s words and seems to agree with the captain that Hinata and Kageyama can learn to work with each
                other. However, he’s quickly disappointed when he sees them arguing over who enters the gym first.

                Tanaka starts practicing with the two, but they argue the entire time. Fed up, Tanaka pauses and pulls
                them aside. He starts by telling them that Daichi is usually kind, but when he’s angry, he’s terrifying.
                In order to not be on the receiving end of Daichi's anger, the two will need to start going better.
                Suddenly, Sugawara enters and greets everyone.

                Tanaka immediately asks how Sugawara found out and Sugawara simply replies that Tanaka’s never on time
                for practice and the fact that he’s asking for the gym key is suspicious. Since Sugawara decides to help
                the two first-years, the practice is split with Tanaka practicing with Kageyama and Hinata with
                Sugawara. As Tanaka trains with Kageyama, he admits that the first-year’s good, but he dislikes his
                attitude.

                Tanaka spends the days leading up to the 3-on-3 match practicing with the other three. Daichi almost
                catches him at one point, when he notices that Tanaka and Sugawara have been looking tired lately.
                Tanaka also meets the other first-years, Yamaguchi and Tsukishima, but he dislikes them right away.
                Sugawara points out that he doesn’t like anyone he meets.

                The day of the 3-on-3, Tanaka gets ready with the others, but gets distracted as Kiyoko walks by him.
                Tsukishima then announces loudly that he’s going to crush the other team and brings up Kageyama’s past.
                Instantly, Tanaka jumps to the two first-years’ defense and retorts that they’re going to pulverize
                Tsukishima.

                The match starts and Tanaka easily blows past Tsukishima’s block. Hinata has more trouble and Tsukishima
                constantly insults him, causing Tanaka to attack back, though Daichi stops him. Tanaka reluctantly backs
                away, but to his surprise, Kageyama replies to Tsukishima that he’s scared of what happened in junior
                high. Hinata then jumps in and adds that he doesn’t care about Kageyama’s past and Tanaka smiles
                approvingly.

                The next move, Hinata and Kageyama perform a quick and Tanaka rushes to the two, surprised at their
                coordination[8]. When Hinata replies that they didn’t plan a quick, a confused Tanaka tries to reason
                with him. Kageyama initially refuses to try it with Hinata, but decides to do it after Tsukishima
                insults Hinata again. The setter vaguely explains a quick to Hinata, who says that he understands, but
                Tanaka doesn’t believe him.

                The quick fails the first time and as Kageyama starts to argue with Hinata, Sugawara steps in. When the
                third year brings up his own faults, Tanaka yells that they’re not true, but Daichi stops him. After
                Sugawara’s talk, the two first years try again and succeed this time. A shocked Daichi reveals that
                Hinata had his eyes closed and Tanaka yells in disbelief before running to Hinata and praising him.


                Tanaka welcomes the first years into the team.

                Tanaka scores the last point for the first set and gives the finger to Tsukishima while challenging him.
                The other second years then tease him and call him “baldy”, annoying him. In the end, Tanaka’s team wins
                and he goes straight to Daichi and Sugawara afterwards. Incredulous, Tanaka asks if the two had known
                that Hinata and Kageyama would be able to synchronize like they had during the match based on the
                third-years initial statements, though they deny it.

                Now that Hinata and Kageyama have won their way into the club and made up with each other, Daichi allows
                them admission and gives them their jackets. Tanaka grins happily as the first-years line up and then
                proceeds to teach Hinata and Kageyama how to pose with their uniforms.</p>
