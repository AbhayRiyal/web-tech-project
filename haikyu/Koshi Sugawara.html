<u><h2 style="color: coral;"> About</h2></u><hr>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Kōshi Sugawara (菅原 孝支, Sugawara Kōshi), often nicknamed Suga, is the vice-captain of the volleyball club and a third-year student at Karasuno High School. He is originally the team's starting setter but is replaced by Tobio Kageyama. In spite of this, Sugawara holds no hard feelings and remains supportive towards both him and the rest of the team, determined to play as much as he can in his final year of high school. He is cheerful, nurturing, and empathetic; so much so, that he is nicknamed "Mr. Pleasant" by Tōru Oikawa. Despite this, Sugawara is known to be "scary when he's mad", and can become hostile when irritated. Highly intelligent and perceptive, he is deeply considerate of the needs of his teammates when on the court; Coach Keishin Ukai notes that he has "the full trust of his teammates". When subbed on, he forms the basis of the team's synchronized attack and is able to utilize Kageyama as an additional spiker. He is also a pinch-server and able to aim his serves accurately to specific places on the court. He is close friends with Daichi and Asahi Azumane, having joined in his first year with them. After the time skip, he is an elementary school teacher.</p>
<u> <h2 style="color: coral;">Personality</h2></u><hr>
<p style="font-size: larger;">Being the vice-captain, he has a soothing and gentle personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. Even though he isn't Karasuno's regular setter anymore, he does not dream of giving up on playing. As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates to never give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.

    Sugawara's dedication to volleyball is clear when he decides to continue club activities even when most third years choose to retire in order to focus on their futures. In a meeting, his teacher asked Sugawara why he's so determined to continue playing even though he's not a starting member, and Sugawara answered that he doesn't want to have regrets in the future.
    
    He is also quite perceptive as he noticed how Tanaka asked for the key to the gym just before the first years' 3-on-3 match even though he always comes in late. He is also intelligent as he can come up with helpful tactics during games that his team members can use. An example of this is when he came up with the idea of saying "bring it" and "send it to me" for Kageyama and Hinata's combo. Sugawara also came up with the hand signals overnight while his teammates were all sleeping.
    
    Despite his nurturing behavior, he is sometimes mischievous, as seen from how he supports Hinata when he crashed the First Year Training Camp uninvited. He also tends to get violent when he teases his teammates, often smacking them around when he's excited to join the game; although this does have the effect of cheering up the team as well.
    
    He is also rather proud, although it is very rarely shown. Notable examples are when he said: "Kageyama, from here on out if you start getting bombarded by interviews, you're gonna say 'I learned everything from a magnificent senpai called Sugawara', got it?", and when he bragged about how he came up with the name of Kageyama and Hinata's new technique 'Back Minus'. During the game with Shiratorizawa, he was so irritated by the loss of their team that he started rambling and pouting, which is very unlike his usual mature demeanor.</p>

            <div class="flex">
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Karasuno High Team Formation Arc
        Sugawara goes with Daichi and Tanaka to the junior high tournament to watch the “King of the Upper Court”[4]. A year later, Sugawara enters the Karasuno gymnasium alongside Daichi and Tanaka to greet the new members of the club: the same players they’d watched in the tournament.
        
        Sugawara approaches Kageyama and remarks that he’s grown taller. Suddenly, Tanaka points out Hinata as the shorty from last year, surprising Sugawara. The third-year compliments Hinata for his jumps and encourages Hinata’s goal of becoming the ace. However, Kageyama quickly criticizes Hinata for it, leading to a small fight that gains the vice principal’s attention. Sugawara and Daichi try to show the vice principal that nothing’s going on, but to no avail as the two first years challenge each other to a mini-match.
        
        The mini-match accumulates with the two knocking the vice principal’s wig off his head and onto Daichi’s head. Sugawara calls out to him in concern before yelling at Tanaka to shut up. Daichi goes outside with the vice principal as Sugawara stares after him. A few minutes later, Daichi returns and rounds everyone up. Sugawara gets scared when he realizes that Daichi’s angry. Daichi gives a small speech to the members as they stand there silently before throwing the two first years out.
        
        The two start pounding on the closed doors as Sugawara turns to Daichi and asks him if he’s sure about this. However, his doubts are cleared when he hears the two arguing outside.
        
        3-on-3 First Years Match
        During a break in practice, Sugawara talks to Tanaka and notes that it’ll be good if the two first years can properly reflect on what they did, even if it’s just a little bit. Daichi adds that Kageyama needs to change his selfish playing style first. Suddenly, they hear the first years call Daichi and Tanaka opens the door to see them still standing there.
        
        Together, they challenge the third years to a match. Daichi changes it to a three-on-three against the other first years and proposes a punishment that if Kageyama loses, he can’t play setter as long as the third years are around. Kageyama reluctantly accepts and as the third years return to practice, Sugawara watches him with sympathy.
        
        After the first years leave, Sugawara asks Daichi if he’s being too tough on them. Daichi explains that he needs the two to get along well because they have the potential to form an incredible team. Later that evening, Tanaka asks for the keys to the gym and a suspicious Sugawara deduces instantly that Tanaka’s planning something with the first years.
        
        The next morning[5], Sugawara comes in early and surprises the underclassmen. He keeps the practice a secret from Daichi though and helps Hinata practice while Kageyama practices with Tanaka. Hinata asks Kageyama for a toss, but the latter adamantly refuses even as Sugawara lightly scolds him.
        
        
        Sugawara helps Hinata with his receives
        
        Later that day, Sugawara practices tossing with Hinata during the lunch break and asks him about his junior high. Hinata reveals the troubles he went through and Sugawara tries to motivate him, but Hinata insists that he wants a toss from Kageyama. Sugawara asks if Hinata sees Kageyama as the strongest enemy. After Hinata reluctantly confirms it, Sugawara reminds him that Kageyama is now his strongest ally so they need to learn to play together.
        
        During practice, Sugawara watches Hinata and Kageyama working together and remark to Tanaka that to receive a toss from a setter is normal for them, but for Hinata, it’s a privilege. Sugawara also notices that Kageyama has changed significantly since junior high, especially when it comes to his confidence in himself.
        
        On the day of the 3-on-3 match, though Sugawara doesn’t play, he watches his teammates and observes the underclassmen’s skills. As Kageyama displays his true skills, Sugawara watches enviously and notes that Kageyama’s truly amazing.
        
        When the two first years try out a quick strike and it fails, Sugawara steps in between their argument with each other and points out that Kageyama’s acting like he’d during junior high. He notes that Hinata may not have the technique or experience needed, but he has the physical ability. Kageyama has the skills to utilize Hinata’s abilities to the fullest potential. As he says this, Sugawara acknowledges that he doesn’t have the same skills so for someone like Kageyama, he should take advantage of what he has[6].
        
        After the match ends in Kageyama and Hinata’s favor, Sugawara stands off to the side with Daichi. Tanaka approaches them and asks if they’d planned for the two first years to get along like this. The two deny it and Sugawara adds that it wasn’t Hinata who matched Kageyama’s toss, but rather Kageyama who matched to the spiker.
        
        As the first years are officially welcomed into the club, Daichi goes to Sugawara and Tanaka and thanks them for making things work. Sugawara tries to deny it, but Daichi implies that he knew about their secret practices. In return, Sugawara compliments Daichi for his work.</p>
